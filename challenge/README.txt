The Enigma Decryption Challenge
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

It is August 1944. The D-Day landings were a huge sucess 
and Allied forces push across France. As the American army
close in on the town of Troyes, Allied listening posts
pick up a number of unusual tranmissions coming from in
and around the town. It is your job to decode these
tranmissions to provide intelligence for the Allied high 
command. 

A log of recent transmissions is provided in the file
transmission-log.txt. It is your job to decode these
transmissions. To help you with this task you have been 
provided with a code book that was acquired by British
special forces in the file codebook.txt.

The first student, or group of students, to e-mail a
fully translated series of communications, along with an 
explanation of how they produced them, to
mjw03@doc.ic.ac.uk will win the decryption challenge.

Hints:

> You may assume that the messages have all been sent 
  in English.

> It is likely that you will need to implement some
  extensions to your enigma machine program.
